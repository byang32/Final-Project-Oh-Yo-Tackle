<h3>Shimano Curado 51e</h3>
<h4>Review by Bee Yang</h4>
<p>The curado 51e is a low profile reel that sits comfortably in your hand. 
    Its lightweight and built to handle big fish. I paired it with a 6ft 8in 
    Medium Heavy Shimano Cumara. The casting is very smooth even when casting 
    into the wind. No once did I birds nest. This is probaly the benifit of 
    the magnetic braking system. Overall a good reel for small game. I would 
    recommend it to anyone who beginning to bait cast.</p>

<h3>Abu Garcia Revo SX</h3>
<h4>Review by Ben Klienschmidt</h4>
<p>My first thought after using this bait caster was "Wow!". The power that you get with 
    this reel is great. On top of that you can cast a great distance if you adjust the gear 
    ratios properly. It is a little on the heavy side compared to reels I have tried in the 
    past but still its a great reel for under $200. With this reel you could either pair it 
    with a medium heavy or heavy rod and youll be ok. Aside form being a little heavy I would
    recommend it.

<h3>St. Croix Legend Elite</h3>
<h4>Review by Bee Yang</h4>
<p>t is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of 
    a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less\
     normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making 
    it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now 
    use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover 
    many web sites still in their infancy. </p>
